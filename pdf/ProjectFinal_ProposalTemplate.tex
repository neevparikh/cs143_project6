% This is a LaTeX document. LaTeX is a markup language for producing documents.
% Your task is to answer the questions by filling out this document, then to 
% compile this into a PDF document. 
% You will then upload this PDF to `Gradescope' - the grading system that we will use. 
% Instructions for upload will follow soon.
%
% 
% TO COMPILE:
% > pdflatex thisfile.tex

% If you do not have LaTeX and need a LaTeX distribution:
% - Departmental machines have one installed.
% - Personal laptops (all common OS): http://www.latex-project.org/get/

\section*{Project}
\begin{itemize}
  \item What is your project idea? \\
      Our project idea is to implement and possibly extend the work done in the paper \textit{Everybody Dance Now} (2018, Chan et. al.) 
  \item What data will you use? \\
      We will record our own video sources as data.
  \item What software/hardware will you use? \\
      We will likely write this in Pytorch and will use GPU compute for this project. 
  \item What are the skills of the team members? Who will do what? \\
      Ryan has the most familiarity with the framework and the research paper. Neev, Nimish and Jason will spend a few days on background reading for this paper. The current idea is that we will split up and work on different parts of the pipelin e (data, GAN, pose estimation etc.) and will switch places so that everyone gets exposed to all the working parts. 
  \item How will you know whether you have made progress? What will you measure? \\
      We plan on replicating the results of the paper and will use their metrics to measure performance. 
  \item What problems do you foresee or have? \\ 
      We forsee problems in tuning the GANs and getting the hyperparameters right. 
  \item Is there anything that we can do to help? E.G., resources, equipment. \\
      We would love it if we could get access to the Brown CS Grid computing cluster for this project. 
  \item 2 pages max; feel free to include any media, references, etc. \\
